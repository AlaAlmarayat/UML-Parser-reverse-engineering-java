# UMLParser
The UML Parser is a web-based application that receives Java source codes as input, analyzes the Java source codes, and finally produces UML Class and Sequence Diagrams. This application uses MySQL data base, I have created a simple database (this application purpose was Revese Engineering NOT a Complex database :D )
